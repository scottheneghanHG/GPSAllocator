## Code Example

When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. The rains of castamere. Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. House Tarly of Horn Hill And now his watch is ended. May the Father judge him justly. Can a man still be brave if he’s afraid? That is the only time a man can be brave.The Knight of Lemonwood.

## Motivation

The battle of the redgrass field. The rains of castamere. The tourney of Ashford Meadows. The North remembers. Words are like wind. The bear and the maiden fair. Pay the iron price. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. A forked purple lightning bolt, on black field speckled with four-pointed stars. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward.

## Installation

Fire and blood. The wolf and the lion. I would like a trial by combat. A Lannister always pays his debts. And now his watch is ended. Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall. A dream of Spring. It's ten thousand miles between Kings landing and the wall. More pigeon pie, please. Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne.
